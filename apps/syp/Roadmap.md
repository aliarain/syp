## MVP Feature Set

### Must-Have Features
1. **Rule Directory**
   - Searchable collection of rules
   - Categorization by language/framework
   - Copy-to-clipboard functionality

2. **Rule Collection**
   - 15-20 high-quality rules
   - Clear documentation for each rule
   - Example outputs

3. **Search & Discovery**
   - Basic search functionality
   - Filtering options
   - Sorting capabilities

4. **Community Basics**
   - Rule submission form
   - Upvote/downvote system
   - Basic moderation tools

### Deferred for Post-MVP
1. User accounts and personalization
2. Advanced analytics on rule usage
3. Rule collections/bundles
4. Direct integration with Cursor (if possible)
5. API for programmatic access

## Technical Requirements
- Simple web application (React or Next.js frontend)
- Database for rule storage (MongoDB or similar)
- Basic authentication for admin functions
- Markdown support for rule documentation

## Success Metrics
- Directory with 20+ functional rules
- Functional search and filtering
- Working submission system
- Positive feedback from 5+ test users

## Risk Assessment
- **Content Quality**: Ensuring rules provide genuine value
- **User Adoption**: Getting users to discover and use the directory
- **Moderation**: Managing potentially low-quality submissions
- **Scope Management**: Keeping the project focused and achievable in one week

## Mitigation Strategies
- Focus on quality over quantity for initial rules
- Create clear documentation on how to use the directory
- Implement basic moderation tools from the start
- Daily check-ins to assess progress and adjust scope
